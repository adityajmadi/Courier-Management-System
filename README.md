# Courier-Management-System
Introduction
A content management system is a computer software
used to manage the creation and modification of digital
content. CMSs are typically used for enterprise content
management and web content management.
Our Team has created a website known as CMS blog
project for listing different watches information. This
blog is about watches which are being collected from
various sources. Frontend and backend both are
developed so that we can get a complete system.
Features
1. Login and sign up page where users can create an
account and log in.
2. A main page where all the watches are listed.
3. Grouped watches by their categories, when clicked
only that category watch will be displayed.
4. Description about the watches for better understanding
of the specifications of the watches.
5. Search feature, so that users can search the watches
which they want based on the keywords.
6. Adding and removing the watches.
7. Comment section in which users can put comments
about the watches.
8. For avoiding spamming there is a feature included for
authorizing those comments by the admin so only
authorized comments will be published on the website.
Technologies Used
Front-end Technologies Used
HTML:The letters in HTML stand for Hypertext Markup Language. The markup
piece of the name is the most important to remember, as markups are the proper
name for HTML elements, which are also called HTML tags. HTML as a whole is the
markup that creates the basic elements we view on a website.
CSS:CSS is what makes everything not look like a white background with a bunch
of Times New Roman texts and blue hyperlinks. Have you ever tried to load Amazon
on a bad day and see nothing but a white page with a huge list of black texts, some
blue links and nothing else? Thatâ€™s Amazon loading without styles. Styles are what
transition beautiful designs onto a site.
JavaScript:JavaScript is a runtime language for web browsers. This means
that when you open a web page, the page will load both the foundational
JavaScript that is standard with the page and any new JavaScript added to a
page. The new JavaScript will load in parallel with it and can perform actions
and make decisions.
Backend Technologies Used is PHP.
PHP:PHP is one of the back end languages which is known as the scripting
language. When a PHP page is requested, the server parses the PHP code, which in
most cases results in dynamically created HTML.
Database Used is MySQL.
MySQL:MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL Database
Management System. MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing
various web-based software applications.
